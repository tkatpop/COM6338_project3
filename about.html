            <p>Candace Hurman has over 30 years of experience in the water. She swam competitively for 12 years, was a lifeguard for 5 years, age-group swim coach for 2 years, and has taught group and private swim lessons. Her #1 priority is water safety, then is working on skills to swim. She teaches by adapting lessons to each child. Her method is to gain their trust before pushing them out of their comfort zone. She believes in challenging them and not scaring them.</p>

            <p>When she is not teaching swimming, Candace Hurman spends time with her two boys and works for a large healthcare company. She has been married for almost 14 years. She enjoys spending most of her time in the water rather than on land. She embodies the company name of being a Mermaid and Tadpole.</p>
